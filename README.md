# Pencil Durability Kata

This repo is my completed example of the Pencil Durability Kata as referenced at: https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-pencil-durability

## Building the code and running the tests

1. Clone the repo
2. Install [.Net 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
3. Navigate in a terminal to the folder root where you cloned the repo to
4. Run "dotnet test" in the terminal

Alternatively, you can run "dotnet build" prior to "dotnet test" in order to check to make sure everything builds, but "dotnet test" will also run "dotnet build" automatically so it's only really necessary to run "dotnet test".
